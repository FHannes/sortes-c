SORTES C language fluency assignment
====================================

This repository contains my implementation of the C language fluency assignment for the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english/) class [Software for Real-time and Embedded Systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H04L2AE.htm).

Assignment
----------

The goal of the assignment was to implement a `malloc()` and `free()` function which managed a 1MiB block of memory with using the C implementations of `malloc()` and `free()` themselves.
